# React To-Do List Project

The main purpose of this application is to implement **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations in a simple to-do list app using React. This project demonstrates key concepts such as state management, dynamic rendering, form validation, local storage integration, and responsive design.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **State Management with `useState`**
- Effectively managed the task list, task input, and task editing state using React's `useState` hook.
- **Key Point:** Demonstrates the ability to manage component state in React.

### 2. **Dynamic Rendering with `.map()`**
- Dynamically renders the list of tasks using the `.map()` method to display tasks on the user interface.
- **Key Point:** Shows proficiency in dynamically rendering lists in React.

### 3. **Conditional Logic for Task Handling**
- Implemented conditional logic to handle both adding new tasks and editing existing ones.
- **Key Point:** Demonstrates the ability to handle conditional rendering and updating values based on the task action.

### 4. **Event Handling**
- Efficiently handled user interactions with event handlers for:
  - `onClick` for buttons (add, edit, delete)
  - `onChange` for input fields (task name input)
- **Key Point:** Demonstrates efficiency in handling user interactions and updating the state.

### 5. **Using Local Storage**
- Integrated local storage to persist the to-do list data across page reloads.
- **Key Point:** Demonstrates the ability to store data locally for a better user experience.

### 6. **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**
- Used Tailwind CSS to ensure the to-do list application is responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Key Point:** Highlights proficiency in creating dynamic and responsive web applications using Tailwind CSS.
